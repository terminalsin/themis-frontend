        <h2>FAULT ANALYSIS</h2>
        <div class="resolution">
            <h3>Resolution: SELF AT-FAULT</h3>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The demo vehicle was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe following distance in heavy traffic conditions. When the lead vehicle braked due to traffic congestion, the demo vehicle was unable to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision. The demo vehicle is at fault for not maintaining proper following distance and failing to adjust driving behavior for traffic conditions.</p>
            
            <h4>Party Analysis:</h4>
            
                <p><strong>SELF:</strong> At Fault</p>
            
                <p><strong>OTHER:</strong> Not At Fault</p>
