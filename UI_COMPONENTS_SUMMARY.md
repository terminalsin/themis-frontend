## Enhanced Mock Data

### API Improvements
- **Multiple Analysis Scenarios**: Added both "other-at-fault" and "self-at-fault" scenarios
- **Detailed Timelines**: 5-point timeline with comprehensive descriptions
- **Random Selection**: Each analysis randomly selects a scenario for variety
- **Rich Descriptions**: Detailed, realistic accident descriptions with technical details

### Mock Analysis Examples
1. **Other-at-Fault Scenario**: Unsafe lane change causing collision
2. **Self-at-Fault Scenario**: Following too closely, rear-end collision

## Technical Features

### Animations & Interactions
- **Smooth Transitions**: All components use consistent transition timing
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and status updates
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover animations on interactive elements

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: All components work on mobile devices
- **Grid Layouts**: Responsive grids that adapt to screen size
- **Flexible Sizing**: Components scale appropriately

### Accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast ratios for readability
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and structure
- **Loading States**: Clear indication of system status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and messaging

## Color Schemes by Step

1. **Processing**: Blue/Gray - Professional, trustworthy
2. **Analysis**: Purple/Blue - AI, intelligence, technology
3. **Timeline**: Green/Teal - Progress, analysis, growth
4. **Resolution**: Dynamic - Green for success, Red for fault, Orange for no case
5. **Document**: Blue/Indigo - Professional, legal
6. **Completed**: Dynamic - Green for success, Orange/Red for consolation

## User Experience Enhancements

### Emotional Design
- **Celebration Elements**: Confetti, emojis, and positive messaging for successful cases
- **Consolation Elements**: Supportive messaging and humor for unsuccessful cases
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear indication of where users are in the process

### Information Architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed at appropriate times
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Important information prominently displayed
- **Contextual Help**: Tooltips and explanations where needed

### Micro-Interactions
- **Button States**: Loading, hover, and active states
- **Animation Timing**: Consistent 300ms transitions
- **Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions

## Integration Points

### API Integration
- All components properly integrated with existing API routes
- Error handling for failed requests
- Loading states during API calls

### State Management
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Local state for UI-specific interactions
- Proper state updates and re-renders

### File Handling
- Video serving from workspace directories
- Photo upload and preview
- Document and meme generation and serving

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components only render when needed
